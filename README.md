Data science test case

EX1:
Find 3 images attached in the email and try to apply a clustering algorithm from your choice
to cluster the food items.

I call first Ex "Segmentation" ,  in this Exercise i tried to use two ways. 1. K-mean algorithm to create masks,
and 2.color space HSV to create mask manually on different range of colors   

EX2: Try to build a model for caption generation from a given image and apply it on the 2 provided
images attached with the test.

I call second Ex "Caption" when i used two algorithm combined together CNN (Convolutional neural network) for instance Resnet-152 
and RNN (Recurrent neural network) for instance LSTM.
This all  model is trained on COCO Dataset
